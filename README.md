The Maveli Chatbot is a voice-enabled assistant designed for competitions, answering questions about Onam with support for English and Malayalam. It uses modules like pyCB2.py. A basic version without GUI for systems without tkinter.
- Chatbot.py: A GUI version using tkinter for a more interactive interface.

While functional, the chatbot has some limitations. For example, instead of matching queries directly, keywords could have been included in the knowledge base dictionary for better efficiency. As a beginner, I wasnâ€™t fully aware of code complexity, which could have improved the design.

Despite these challenges, the chatbot provides a fun, educational way to explore Onam traditions through technology.
